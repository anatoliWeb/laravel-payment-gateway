# TODO — Billing & Payment Gateway Module

## Project Direction

We are not creating a standalone payment gateway.

We are extending the existing Laravel SaaS foundation with a Billing & Payment module.

The goal is to demonstrate Senior Backend Developer skills through:

- SaaS billing architecture
- paid plans
- paid chat features
- future paid dialer/calling features
- payment gateway simulator
- payment transactions
- idempotency
- webhook callbacks
- queues
- cron/scheduled jobs
- activity logging
- API-first design
- Service Layer
- DTO
- FormRequest validation
- tests
- documentation

- [x] Add tests that admin role has billing/payment permissions
- [x] Add tests that normal users do not get admin billing permissions by default
- [x] Document billing RBAC in `docs/billing/rbac.md`

Billing RBAC permissions must be seeded before billing/payment API endpoints are exposed. Admin should receive billing management permissions, while normal users should access only their own billing data through ownership checks, not global admin permissions.

---

## Phase 11 — Paid Chat Features

- [x] Define free chat limits
- [x] Define paid chat limits
- [x] Define chat messages per day limit
- [x] Define chat webhooks limit
- [x] Define chat history retention limit

Phase 11 implementation scope:
- Chat message creation is limited by `chat.messages.daily` and `chat.messages.monthly`.
- Chat attachment upload is limited by `chat.attachments.monthly`.
- Chat webhook endpoint creation is limited by `chat.webhook_endpoints.count`.
- Limit exceeded responses use stable code `feature_limit_exceeded`.
- Limit exceeded attempts are logged as `chat.feature_limit_exceeded`.
- Billing guards are inactive only when no billing plans exist yet; once a billing catalog exists, chat feature keys are enforced strictly.

---

## Phase 12 — Future Dialer Billing Foundation

- [x] Define reusable billing feature names for dialer
- [x] Define future `dialer.calls.monthly`
- [x] Define future `dialer.recordings.storage`

- [x] Define rounding rules
- [x] Add currency seeders
- [x] Add tests for currencies
- [x] Add tests for exchange rates
- [x] Document currencies in `docs/billing/currencies.md`

Currency support is required before wallet balances and multi-currency payments. Exchange rates in this portfolio project can be manual/simulated and must not depend on real external providers.

---

## Phase 12.2 — User Wallet Balance

- [ ] Add wallet activity logs
- [x] Add tests for wallet balance operations
- [x] Add tests for multi-currency wallet balances
- [x] Document wallet balance in `docs/billing/wallets.md`

Users may pay either from internal wallet balance or directly through a payment method. Wallet debits must be transactional and idempotent to avoid double-charging or granting access without a valid debit.

---

## Phase 12.3 — Payment Methods & User Payment Preferences

- [x] Design `payment_methods` table
- [x] Design `user_payment_preferences` table
- [x] Define fake card payment method
- [x] Define fake manual invoice payment method
- [x] Define fake wallet/internal balance payment method

- [x] Define payment strategy: wallet only
- [x] Define payment strategy: card/payment method only
- [x] Define payment strategy: wallet first with card fallback
- [x] Define payment strategy: manual approval only if needed
- [x] Store explicit user consent for saved payment method
- [x] Store explicit user consent for auto charge
- [x] Store explicit user consent for auto top-up
- [x] Add payment method metadata rules
- [x] Add payment method masking rules
- [x] Ensure no raw card data is stored
- [x] Add payment method seed/demo data if needed
- [x] Add tests for payment methods

---

## Phase 13.1 — Payment Risk & Fraud Guard

- [ ] Define payment risk rules
- [ ] Add payment risk check before payment creation
- [ ] Add user payment blacklist check
- [ ] Add max failed payment attempts per period
- [ ] Add max payment creation attempts per hour/day
- [ ] Add suspicious payment activity flags
- [ ] Add blocked payment reason
- [ ] Add payment risk metadata
- [ ] Add activity log for blocked payments
- [ ] Add activity log for suspicious attempts
- [ ] Ensure risk guard does not replace idempotency
- [ ] Ensure idempotency still prevents duplicate payment creation
- [ ] Add tests for payment blacklist
- [ ] Add tests for failed-attempt limits
- [ ] Add tests for suspicious activity blocking
- [ ] Document payment risk guard in `docs/billing/payment-risk.md`

Payment Risk & Fraud Guard is a demo-safe risk layer for the simulator. It is not a real bank-grade antifraud system.

---

## Phase 13.2 — Auto Top-Up & Auto Charge

- [ ] Design user payment method preference
- [ ] Design auto top-up settings
- [ ] Design auto charge settings
- [ ] Allow user to choose wallet balance only
- [ ] Allow user to choose card/payment method only
- [ ] Allow user to choose wallet first, then card fallback
- [ ] Allow user to enable/disable automatic charges
- [ ] Add minimum wallet balance threshold
- [ ] Add auto top-up amount
- [ ] Add max auto top-up per day/month
- [ ] Add failed auto top-up handling
- [ ] Add auto charge consent tracking
- [ ] Add activity log for auto charge consent changes
- [ ] Add activity log for automatic balance top-up
- [ ] Add activity log for automatic subscription charge

- [ ] Add tests for wallet-first payment strategy
- [ ] Add tests for card-only payment strategy
- [ ] Add tests for max auto top-up limits
- [ ] Document auto top-up in `docs/billing/auto-top-up.md`

Auto top-up and auto charge require explicit user consent. In this simulator project, external payment provider behavior is fake, but consent, limits, idempotency, and audit logging must be modeled seriously.

---

## Phase 13.3 — Wallet/Card Payment API Interface

- [ ] Plan `GET /api/v1/billing/wallet`
- [ ] Plan `GET /api/v1/billing/wallet/balances`
- [ ] Plan `GET /api/v1/billing/wallet/transactions`

- [ ] Add tests for card/payment-method payment API
- [ ] Add tests for wallet-first fallback API
- [ ] Add tests for payment preferences API
- [ ] Document payment API interface in `docs/billing/payment-api.md`

This API layer must allow users to pay from internal wallet balance, from a saved/simulated payment method, or by wallet-first fallback depending on user preferences. All write operations that can create charges, wallet debits, or payment attempts must be idempotent.

This project uses a payment gateway simulator by default. Real payment providers are intentionally not connected in portfolio/demo mode. The architecture must support provider adapters, platform-level `.env` credentials, customer-level database credentials, encrypted credential storage, webhook verification, idempotency propagation, and provider-specific documentation/templates for Stripe/PayPal/LiqPay/WayForPay-style integrations.

---

- [ ] Add tests or static checks for provider documentation if useful

Adding a new provider should be repeatable: create a provider folder, implement the provider interface, define capabilities, document configuration fields, map errors, implement webhook verification, and add provider-specific tests. This phase prepares the project so future providers can be added without changing core payment logic.
